# Brightness / Gamma page — 2026-10-04

The retail "Brightness calibration" screen is only a reference pattern for adjusting the monitor: it has no slider and never rewrites the display gamma ramp. Graphics > **Brightness / Gamma** now opens a host page with two settings and a before/after preview; the retail screen is a button on it and returns to the page with the unsaved values.

## Settings

- `display_brightness` (-20..20, default 0) moves the black point: the curve is `clamp((x - k) / (1 - k), 0, 1)` with `k = -brightness / 200`, so +20 lifts black to about 23/255 and -20 crushes the bottom 10 % while white stays at 1.
- `display_gamma` (50..150 hundredths, default 100) then applies `x^(100 / gamma)`; higher is brighter midtones.
- Both apply live after saving. The settings menu previews its unsaved values; gameplay uses the saved ones (`settings::GetBrightnessCalibration`).

## Presentation

- The curve lives in the `.w` channel of the display gamma ramp's 256-entry constant buffer (`.rgb` is the guest ramp), so no layout, descriptor or push-constant change. The three buffers rotate when the guest ramp or the curve changes; only draws that set `displayAdjust`, `brightnessPreview` or `hdrCalibration` load new curve values.
- Scanout order in `finishFrame`: guest ramp, Expanded RGB range, player curve, HDR output conversion. Putting the curve after the expansion keeps black at 0 and white at 1 with or without Expanded RGB range.
- The preview (`outputFlags` 512) is not tied to linear output: the left half is the game image (ramp and expansion), the right half adds the curve, and both go through the same `outputSignal` conversion as gameplay. Without a frozen scene it shows a grey ramp, ten steps and eight near-black patches. The HDR calibration scene also gets the curve (4096).

## Frozen scene

- The game resolves every frame to one frontbuffer (0x714000 in Uhra), so its own menu overwrites the scene before the host menu opens; the earlier HDR preview copied at host-menu entry and therefore only worked for overlays opened over gameplay.
- The renderer counts depth-tested, depth-writing draws per frame and records the count on each resolve (`renderer::ResolvedScene`). Gameplay draws about 1,180; the game's menus and their blurred backdrop draw 5. The tone-map pass is not a usable signal: it also runs for menu frames.
- Gameplay frames copy the resolve into two textures in turn every 250 ms. The format is fixed when they are allocated (the FP16 extended-gamma twin if the first frame has one, otherwise RGBA8); later frames without that twin are skipped instead of reallocating. The first frame without the scene, or a host menu, freezes the older copy: the frame where the game's menu starts its blur still draws the 3D world. The next gameplay frame unfreezes and starts fresh copies.
- The two copies stay allocated for the session: at a 4K FP16 render resolution about 130 MB, at 1080p RGBA8 about 16 MB. The previous design held no memory during gameplay but never had a scene when opened from the game's menu.

## Validation

- Windows RTX 5080, Uhra save, 1600x900, 120 FPS, opened from Y > System > Settings: the page shows the last field frame on D3D12 in SDR and HDR and on Vulkan in HDR (`extended=true`); the HDR peak page shows it too, and LB / RB switch scene and pattern on both pages. With Expanded RGB range on and gamma 1.30 saved, D3D12 SDR gameplay luminance quantiles moved 1 % 0→0, median 92→116 (predicted 116.4), 99.9 % 251→252.
- LoMenuFlowTest (page open, edit, retail hand-off and return, Back over A), LoMenuRenderTest and LoPresentationTest (14/14 on D3D12 and Vulkan) pass.
- Not checked: Metal, Android.
